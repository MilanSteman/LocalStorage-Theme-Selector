# Vanilla Example

This vanilla javascript example is written with the least lines of code in mind. A helper function like a setter and getter for the theme could be written to give more structure to the project. A check is done in the local storage on runtime if nothing is found in the local storage, it checks the System OS for the preferred theme. It updates a data-theme attribute given to the body element. ```HTML 
<body data-theme="dark">
```
